Using:

1) Shaders
1.1)The parameter "speed" in the material is responsible for the speed of flapping the wings.
1.2)The “Wing max down” parameter in the material is responsible for the lowering amount of the wings.
1.3)Always use custom data to flap butterflies wings at different times (see the "Render" tab and "Custom Data" tab)

2)Scale
2.2) If you want to change the scale of butterflies in the particle system, then you also need to change the "Wind power" in the material!
Example: particles scale 0.05 + Wind power 0.08 > particles scale 0.1 + Wind power 0.16 > particles scale 0.02 + Wind power 0.03
