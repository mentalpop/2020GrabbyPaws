/*
Farmer Example

In this non-interactive scene, rabbits wander the field. 
Wolves eat rabbits. 

Rabbits will learn to avoid wolves. The farmer will learn
to dislike wolves for eating his rabbits. The wolves will
learn to avoid the farmer. 

This is driven by affinities. As wolves eat rabbits, other
rabbits will lower their affinity to wolves. When affinity
is low enough, they'll flee wolves. As the farmer sees
wolves eat rabbits, he'll lower his affinity to wolves.
When affinity is low enough, he'll chase wolves.
