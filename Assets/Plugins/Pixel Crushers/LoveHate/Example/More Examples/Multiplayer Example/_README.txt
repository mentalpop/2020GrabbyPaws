Multiplayer Example

This example was written for the legacy networking API. It's not supported
in higher versions of Unity that have removed this API. However, the 
LoveHate Multiplayer Guide document is still valid for all versions of 
Unity.

To play the multiplayer example:

1. Import the package "Multiplayer Example Files". These files are stored in
a separate unitypackage because the scripts use the legacy (pre-Unity 5.1)
networking API. In Unity 5.1, they will generate warnings but run without
issue.

2. Add the scene to the project's build settings.

3. Create a desktop build of the scene.

One player should click "Start Server".

The other player(s) should then click "Refresh Hosts" and click
on the hosted game, "Love/Hate Room".

Multiplayer considerations for Love/Hate are discussed in depth
in the document "LoveHate Multiplayer Guide.pdf".
